======================================

The following is just a list of ideas for editor functionality and user
interface.  Something
to start a discussion.  I'd love some feedback here...

Include ability to store document locally in the following formats --
    Flat text   + editor language extension (including XML...)
    Language specific documentation   + code r/o or hidden
    REST
    OPML
    RTF   + text styling
    HTML   + text styling + linking

Text storage supports formatting (above), encoding, and storage access means
(SFTP, CVS, SVN, etc) all by extendable plug-in interfaces

Include option to store session meta-data
    Authorship meta-data list including --
        Handle
        Name
        E-mail address / URL
        Session IM / IP address
        Affiliation / copyright
        Authored text colorization
        Contribution read/write authorization
        Session read/write authorization
        Document mastership flag
        Last submission date / time

    Document style sheet
        Styles include not only text and document meta-data, but also
        document navigation, indexing, and inter-document linking. 

    Document (sets) repository address, access means, and versioning policy
        I wouldn't mind if we largely bypassed OS specific file selection
        storage dialogs with document archival policy meta-data panels.

Include option to set text read-only by author and declare authorship
meta-data for imported text.

Preference windows / linked documents --
    Logon-user default editor preferences
    Logon-user default meta-data
    Document author meta-data
    Document style sheet
    Document encoding, format, and presentation filter setting
    Document (sets) repository address, and versioning policy
    Clip-board(s)
    Users accessible via zeroconf (,IM...)
    Document advertise, joint management by document master
    Alias list of user selected editor menu bar items and their icons

    Recent accessed document list
    Recent archived style list
    Recent logged author list
        Recent.. lists are editable (per user) history documents listing
        preference (example: named styles) and navigation aliases

Text editor windows includes an optional left collapsible hierarchical
document navigation panel.  The displayed hierarchy merges document storage,
document navigation, document meta-data, and edit preference data document
navigation.  The right editor panel can optionally be vertically broken so as
to display a user selected set of multiple document views (by chapter, line
number, method...), documents, meta-data, and preferences.  The editor menu
bar will then contain very few required sub-menus.

Document meta-data and edit session preferences all manipulated as linked
human editable (and copy and paste-able) text documents using some standard
format (seen several I like) somewhere between REST and XML.  Editing is
facilitated by representing required data structures, error, and status fields
as tinted read-only text, and available option menus by tool tips.

Clip board to include text segment meta-data?  Stored authorship to include
optional author smoothing filter to purge spelling correction 'line noise'?
